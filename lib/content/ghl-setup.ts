// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const ghlSetupFaq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What does the GoHighLevel setup include?",
    answer:
      "The implementation covers CRM pipeline configuration, custom contact fields, calendar and booking setup, core automation workflows, email authentication, phone/SMS setup, and a structured handover with documentation. Everything is configured specifically for your business — not applied from a generic template.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the implementation take?",
    answer:
      "Timeline varies based on scope and complexity. A standard implementation includes a structured build phase followed by testing and handover. We'll scope the timeline during the initial strategy call based on your specific requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with an existing GoHighLevel account?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We regularly work with existing accounts — both fully unused and partially configured. We audit what's already in place, identify what needs to be corrected or rebuilt, and complete the implementation from that starting point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you fix a partial or incorrect setup?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Partial implementations are common. We'll assess what's configured, what's misconfigured, and what's missing — then build a clear plan to complete and correct the setup. We'll give you a clear assessment before any work begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with agencies as well as direct businesses?",
    answer:
      "Both. For agencies, we can configure account settings, default structures, and sub-account templates to support efficient client onboarding. For direct businesses, we configure GHL for your specific operational workflow. We scope the right approach during the strategy call.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information is needed to get started?",
    answer:
      "Access to your GoHighLevel account, an understanding of your lead flow and sales process, and any third-party tools or integrations you need connected. We provide a structured intake process — most clients have everything ready within a short onboarding session.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate GoHighLevel with third-party tools?",
    answer:
      "We configure native integrations and set up webhooks and API connections where applicable. The scope of third-party integrations depends on the specific tools involved — we'll assess feasibility during scoping.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the implementation is complete?",
    answer:
      "We provide structured documentation of everything configured, a walkthrough session so your team understands the system, and a support period for questions and adjustments. Ongoing support arrangements can be discussed based on your needs.",
  },
